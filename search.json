Add freshman Bekka Allick into the mix as well as Batenhorst and Lauenstein and Nebraska has built a force to be reckoned with at the net. But so has Louisville, who averages around three blocks a set. Oregon on the other hand doesn’t have a team who competes in the top 50 when it comes to blocking. If Nebraska can win the blocking game against Oregon they have a chance to shine and continue into the elite eight.\nA possible matchup between Louisville and Nebraska is what every volleyball fan dreams of, an even match up between a one and a two seed for a trip to Omaha, this game could truly go to either team, it is going to come down to whoever wants it more."
